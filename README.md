# Azure Sentinel Honeypot Monitoring Project

<h2>üõ°Ô∏èProject Summary</h2>

Set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) to actively monitor a virtual machine honeypot, capturing live RDP Brute Force attack data from global sources. This project leverages a custom PowerShell script to fetch the geo-location of attackers and dynamically plots them on the Azure Sentinel Map for real-time threat visualization.

<h2>Powershell for VM</h2>

The Powershell script in this repository is responsible for parsing out Windows Event Log information for failed RDP attacks and using a third party API to collect geographic information about the attackers location.

The script is used in this project where I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map!
