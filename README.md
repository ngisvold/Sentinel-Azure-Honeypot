# Failed RDP Lookup IP Geolocation Information

<h2>üõ°Ô∏è</h2>

The Powershell script in this repository is responsible for parsing out Windows Event Log information for failed RDP attacks and using a third party API to collect geographic information about the attackers location.

The script is used in this project where I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map!
