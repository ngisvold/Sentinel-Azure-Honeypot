<h2>üõ°Ô∏èProject Summary</h2>

Set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) to actively monitor a virtual machine honeypot, capturing live RDP Brute Force attack data from global sources. This project leverages a custom PowerShell script to fetch the geo-location of attackers and dynamically plots them on the Azure Sentinel Map for real-time threat visualization.

<h3>Azure Sentinel Honeypot Project Steps:</h3>

1. Initialize VM: Begin by configuring the fundamental settings of the VM Windows 10/11 Image.

2. Intentionally Vulnerable Configuration: In a deliberate deviation from best cybersecurity practices, configure the VM to be as exposed as possible for the purpose of this experiment. This involves:

- Opening the network firewall to accept all incoming connections.
- Disabling the Windows VM Defender Firewall.

</p>
  
*Warning: This atypical setup is intentionally designed to test the capabilities of Azure Sentinel SIEM and should not be replicated for production or sensitive environments.

<h3>Setting Up Log Analysis and Data Collection:</h3>

1. Establish a Log Analytics Workspace: Begin by creating a Log Analytics Workspace in Azure. This workspace will be crucial for ingesting logs using Sentinel.

</p>

2. Configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud:

- Navigate to Microsoft Defender for Cloud within Azure.
- Access the Environment Settings and ensure that only the "Servers" option is enabled.
- Proceed to the Data Collection section. Here, select "All Events" specific to the vulnerable VM we configured earlier.

</p>

- Connect the Data Log to the Workspace.

<h3>Integrating Azure Sentinel:</h3>

1. Add Azure Sentinel to the Workspace:
- Navigate to your previously created Log Analytics Workspace in Azure.
- From within the workspace, select Azure Sentinel.
- Click on the Add button to integrate Azure Sentinel with the workspace, enabling it to ingest and analyze the collected data.

<h3>Simulating RDP Attack & Gathering Location Data:</h3>h3>

1. Simulate a Failed RDP Logon:

- Log into the configured VM.
- Intentionally use an incorrect password for login. This will generate a failed RDP logon event that will appear in the Windows Event Viewer's Security Logs.

2. Install and Configure the PowerShell Script:

- Download and use the provided PowerShell script from this repository. This script is designed to extract information from the Windows Event Log related to failed RDP attacks.
 -  <a href='https://github.com/ngisvold/Sentinel-Azure-RDP-Attack/blob/main/Security_Log_Exporter.ps1'>Security_Log_Exporter.ps1</a>
 
-  Additionally, the script interfaces with a third-party API to retrieve geographical information pertaining to the attacker's location.


3. API Key Acquisition & Configuration:

- Obtain an API key for the IP address-to-geolocation service from IPGeolocation.
  - IP Address to Geolocation API - https://ipgeolocation.io 
-Configure the PowerShell script with the obtained API key, which allows Azure Sentinel to visualize the source locations of the attacks.

4.Execute the PowerShell Script:

-Run the Security_Log_Exporter.ps1 script.
-After execution, a log file will be generated and stored at C:\ProgramData.

5. Log File Management:

-Copy the generated log file and create a new one.
-Navigate to the Log Analytics workspace in Azure.
-Upload the new log file to the workspace and designate it as a custom log.
